When the internet goes down, most apps stop working. Geogram keeps going.

Geogram connects devices directly - phone to phone, laptop to laptop - without requiring servers, accounts, or infrastructure you don't control. Messages hop between devices over whatever path works: WiFi when available, Bluetooth when it's not, internet when you want global reach.

Every message is signed with cryptographic keys, so you always know who you're talking to. No spoofing, no impersonation.

Built for communities that need to communicate when things get difficult: remote areas, disaster response, places where the network is censored or unreliable, or people who believe their conversations shouldn't depend on corporate infrastructure.

STATION SERVER

Your phone can be a server. Your laptop can be a server. Geogram runs station software on any device, turning personal hardware into community infrastructure. Nothing lives on someone else's cloud. No monthly fees, no account required.

OFFLINE MAPS

Worldwide satellite imagery and street maps that work without internet. Pan and zoom anywhere using cached tiles stored locally or synced from a nearby station. No API keys, no usage limits.

DEVICE DISCOVERY

Geogram finds other devices around you automatically. Someone on the same WiFi? They appear in your device list. Within Bluetooth range? They show up too. Communication adapts to available connections.
